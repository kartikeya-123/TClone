## Features

The portal majorly consists of two parts:

- Student Interaction
- Classroom Management

### Student Interaction

Getting the right people to discuss and collaborate at the right time is often tough, more so when the semester goes on virtually.
We provide three forum to reduce this gap.

#### Discover

A directory of our students which supports search based on skills, positions of responsibilities, student activities and, of course, branch and year.

#### Project Panel

A platform where students can post there projects with relevant details and supporting tags and ask for collaborators by provding necessary communication details. Students are notified when a project's tag matches one in their profile.

#### Discussion Forum

A forum where students can ask questions to each other and their seniors. The forum also allows anonymous questions and answers to allow free expression of views.

### Classroom Management

The portal is to promote effective classroom interaction and assginment management.

College admins can create courses with teachers in it. Teachers thus can enroll students in their courses. <br/>
Students can have realtime chats in the classroom with peers and teacher. Teachers can post assignments with deadlines and review the submission. Students are provided with a calender where they can view all assignments having deadlines on a particular date.
